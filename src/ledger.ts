// The sync ledger: every tracked session sorted into exactly one bucket, and
// the one percentage `hx status` prints.
//
// Why this exists — the old `Sync 97%` was `min(offsets) >= size` folded over
// every file (see snapshotFrom). Two things made that number unreadable:
//
//   1. minOffset() collapses destinations. A session fully delivered to the
//      primary store but 0% delivered to a second, OFFLINE Fortress scored 0
//      and counted as "not done". One unreachable destination therefore held
//      the whole device below 100% forever — the number could only reach 100%
//      if every Fortress the device had ever fanned out to was simultaneously
//      online.
//   2. A live session always has a few unsent bytes between the write and the
//      next ~1.5s tick, so an in-use machine never sat at 100% either.
//
// The percentage here answers "is anything wrong?", not "is every byte
// everywhere?". Sessions the user cannot act on — a tail still being written,
// a store that is offline — leave the denominator entirely, so a healthy
// machine rests at 100%. Leaving 100% now means exactly one of two things: a
// real backlog that is draining, or real data loss. Both are worth reading.
