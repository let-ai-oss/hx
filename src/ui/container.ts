// Container detection for `hx ui`.
//
// Why the UI cares: on a normal host, `hx ui` binds 127.0.0.1 and opens the
// browser for you. Inside a container that loopback is the CONTAINER's own
// loopback, so your host browser can't reach it — the page never loads. To make
// a published port (`docker run -p 8000:8000`) actually forward to us, we must
// listen on 0.0.0.0 instead. We switch that bind automatically when we detect a
// container, so plain `hx ui` keeps working with no extra flags.
//
// Is auto-binding 0.0.0.0 a security downgrade? No. The bind address only picks
// which interfaces the socket listens on; it is NOT the access boundary. Two
// gates do that, both independent of the bind:
//   (1) the Host-header allowlist (only localhost/127.0.0.1/[::1] spellings) —
//       this stops a BROWSER (DNS-rebinding) and any raw-IP hit (a request to
//       the container IP 403s), but a non-browser peer can forge Host: localhost,
//       so it is not the peer gate;
//   (2) the per-run session token (256-bit, never sent to a peer) — THIS stops a
//       network peer: a sibling container on the bridge can reach the socket and
//       forge the Host header, but without the token it gets only the data-free
//       static shell and a version string.
// Nothing leaves the container regardless of bind unless the operator runs `-p`
// (an explicit publish gesture). Caveat: `docker run --network host` shares the
// host's netns, so 0.0.0.0 is then a real LAN bind (still token-gated) — the
// price of collapsing network isolation. See SECURITY.md.
//
// We deliberately do NOT try to detect whether the port was published (`-p`):
// Docker injects no signal about the host's port mapping into the container.
// Since a container started without `-p` is exactly the unreachable case, `hx
// ui` always prints the make-it-reachable instructions when it's in a container.
