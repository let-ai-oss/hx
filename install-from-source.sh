# hx — build-from-source installer + connect entrypoint.
#
# Reaches the same running, connected hx daemon as the prebuilt
# `curl … | sh` installer, but compiles the binary locally from this checkout
# instead of downloading it. Everything after the build — seeding the gateway
# URL into ~/.let/hx/config.json and the interactive `hx connect` device flow
# (which opens your browser) — is identical to the binary installer.
#
# Usage (the gateway URL is optional and defaults to beta, i.e. current prod):
#
#   ./install-from-source.sh [gateway-url]
#
# where <gateway-url> is your workbench's hx gateway, e.g.
# https://<your-workbench>/_api/hx-gateway.

# Without this, ~/.let/bin is on no shell's PATH and `hx` is not a command the
# user can type — not in this terminal, and not in a new one either. The build
# above only drops a binary; `hx connect` below reaches it by absolute path, so
# the gap is invisible until the user types plain `hx` and gets "command not
# found". The prebuilt one-line installer does this same append; from-source
# installs are entitled to a working `hx` too.
#
# rc file, the PATH line, and the keyword that loads rc all depend on the shell:
#   zsh            -> ~/.zshrc                    'source'
#   bash on darwin -> ~/.bash_profile             'source'  (Terminal.app runs
#                                                  bash as a LOGIN shell, which
#                                                  reads .bash_profile, not
#                                                  .bashrc)
#   bash on linux  -> ~/.bashrc                   'source'
#   fish           -> ~/.config/fish/config.fish  'source'  (fish syntax)
#   anything else  -> ~/.profile                  '.'       (sh has no 'source')
#
# $SHELL is only the *login* shell from the password DB; it doesn't change when
# the user starts a different shell. The shell that invoked this script is our
# parent, so read its name off $PPID and fall back to $SHELL when ps can't say.
#
# Only match shells a human sits in: an sh/dash parent is nearly always a
# wrapper (`sh install-from-source.sh`, a Makefile), and trusting it would send

# --- seed the gateway into config.json (single source of truth) --------
# hx reads the gateway from ~/.let/hx/config.json; `hx connect` writes the
# device token alongside it. There is no --gateway flag and no env var, so the
# gateway MUST be on disk before connect runs. Three cases, matching the binary
# installer:
#
#   1. No config.json    -> seed gatewayBaseUrl so `hx connect` knows where to
#                           call.
#   2. Same gateway      -> leave it untouched, so a rebuild never clobbers a
#                           live device token.
#   3. Different gateway -> the device follows this build's gateway. Stop any
#                           running daemon (it holds the old gateway + token in
#                           memory), drop state.json (per-gateway upload offsets
#                           the new gateway doesn't have), and write a fresh
#                           config with only the new gateway. The old token
#                           authenticated only the old gateway and is dropped
#                           with it; `hx connect` mints a new one below.
